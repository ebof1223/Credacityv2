      "I applied for the Chase Sapphire Reserve then the Preferred back to back (within minutes). I got the \"We need to review your application. We'll get back to you in 30 days\" message for both applications. I called the automated status line and it said that both of my apps were under review and that I'd hear back in about two weeks. I calledRecon immediately (and only mentioned my Sapphire Preferred application) and they wanted to verify my information. The rep got my info and told me that she'd put my application through. I called to check the automated status line again and it said that one of the apps was under review and I would hear back in 7-10 days. The other application still had the two weeks message. FYI, the automated line did not tell me which application corresponded to which card. So I waited about an hour or two and called the status line again. The first app had the 7-10 days message and the second app was approved! I called a Chase representative immediately and asked which card I had just been approved for. It was the Sapphire Reserve for $10k starting limit. I just got a $15k Capital One Venture card a couple weeks ago, but it's not on my credit report and all my other credit is under $5k, so that explains the low limit. I was denied for the Sapphire Preferred because too many recent requests for credit (basically because I was just approved for the Reserve). That was fine with me because I only wanted the Reserve anyway and applied for both for insurance. Also, since I applied within minutes of each other I only got 1 hard pull. I have a 757 FICO Experian score and $80k income. I am 21 years old. 3 years AAoA.",

Got denied for SW Premier and approved/right away close the SW Plus.\n\nI called the recon for Carlson and said that I have been paying all my cards in full and not carrying a balance. My creditScore is 750 on credit karma and utilization is around 3%. She was like we need to atleast see 6 months of credit payment history on those cards before we can reconsider it. I even said that I make trips to Europe and I like this card for its benefits.\n\nAny help on what should I say when I call again in a few hours?",

      "Just wanted to offer my data point - I applied for a few cards the other day, one of which was the AMEX Green 25k/1k spend. I was automatically denied. I called AMEX to find out why and was told it was because I had a returned payment.\nThis returned payment was due to my incorrectly setting up a bank account on one of my AMEX cards. I accidentally switched two numbers on my account, so when the auto-payment attempted, it was logged as returned. I called to fix it and they corrected the bank account information and the payment went through fine.\nI was told by AMEX that it was automatically denied because of the returned payment. After explaining the situation and notifying them that I paid and was current and that it was just a mix up, she moved my application over to reconsideration and I will hear soon on the outcome. Will keep everyone posted.\nAdded Note: (this is known to many already but) I was told that they checked my AMEX history first and although I was denied I did not receive a HP. I was told that moving the application over could result in a HP since they check AMEX history before pulling credit information.",

After a barrage of questions, including about the nature of the business, revenues, and other sources of income, I was denied. The denial was based on several factors. 1) I had too much available credit across my personal lines and was "maxed out" with Chase. 2) Business revenues were too low and I wasn\'t showing year-over-year growth.\nGoing into the call I had about 60k in available credit with Chase. I maintained I have an income of just over 100k. This was whittled down to around 70k by the CSR. I took a liberal definition of "credit available to you"; she narrowed it. After dropping my available credit to about 40k and FIVE recon calls I was approved.',

After about a min wait he then said I would be transferred to the lending department for business verification. I\'m okay with this because I have a legitimate business renting property (as a sole proprietor), so figured no sweat. However when on hold music I got another call that was more important. By the time my other call finished the bank call had dropped. I called the automated verification line and got the response that decision was pending and to be notified by 30 days. Next day I called the automated verification line and got notification that I\'m approved and my card is "on it\'s way by 10 business days".',

Since the Chase application has a checkbox saying that "I haven\'t been denied of credit by Chase in the last 6 months," I waited until the 6 months was up (1/13/16). \nFor this application I submitted all the same information; the only difference was I didn\'t call recon.
